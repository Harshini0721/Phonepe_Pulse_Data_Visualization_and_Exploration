# Phonepe_Pulse_Data_Visualization_and_Exploration

Problem Statement:
The Phonepe pulse Github repository contains a large amount of data related to various metrics and statistics. The goal is to extract this data and process it to obtain insights and information that can be visualized in a user-friendly manner. The solution must include the following steps:

Extract data from the Phonepe pulse Github repository through scripting and clone it..
Transform the data into a suitable format and perform any necessary cleaning and pre-processing steps.
Insert the transformed data into a MySQL database for efficient storage and retrieval. +. Create a live geo visualization dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly in Python to display the data in an interactive and visually appealing manner.
Fetch the data from the MySQL database to display in the dashboard. +. Provide at least 10 different dropdown options for users to select different facts and figures to display on the dashboard. The solution must be secure, efficient, and user-friendly. The dashboard must be easily accessible and provide valuable insights and information about the data in the Phonepe pulse Github repository.

Workflow:
Step1
We need to import the necessary libraries/modules for the code to work. If the libraries already there it is not necessary to install the libraries or other wise user have to install that library by using.

Step2
Clone the Phonepe pulse Github repository and extract the data through scripting.

Step3
pre-process and clean the data using python and pandas library.

Step4
store the transformed data into a MySQL database using the “mysql-connector-python”libarary.

Step5
Use streamlit and plotly libraries in python to create an interactive and visually appealing dasboard.

Findings:
As per the phonepe data Most of the Insurance Transaction amount are made by Maharashtra , Karanataka , Andhra Pradesh state and District wise Bangalore , Pune , Thane been the top for 2020,2021,2022,2023.
Same for Transactions like peer to peer or merchant or Recharge & Bill Payment or Financial services or other transaction are mostly made by Maharashtra , Andhra , Karanataka .
Brands like Xiaomi , Samsung , Vivo users use alot compare to other brands.
More than 500 million people use phonepe for online transactions .
Each State and districts been part of using Digital transactions and Many merchants start using Online mode of payments.
Still some rural area people are not much flexible of using online payment mode due to lack of knowledge and frauds and scared to use online payments
The Evolution of Online payment app has been devloped each year and mostly used after covid period compare to past years.
Online transaction have certain limits so still people perfer offline transaction like banks,cash in hand.
Even though online transaction save time and 24/7 availability platform compare to offline

conclusion:
our solution leverages Python and its powerful libraries to extract, transform, and analyze data from the Phonepe Pulse GitHub repository.
By using the "mysql-connector-python" library, we efficiently store and retrieve the transformed data in a MySQL database.
We create an interactive and visually appealing dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly, allowing users to select different facts and figures to display.
Finally, we ensure the solution is secure, efficient, and user-friendly by thoroughly testing and deploying the dashboard publicly.
Overall, our solution provides valuable insights and information about the data in the Phonepe Pulse GitHub repository in an accessible and visually appealing manner.
